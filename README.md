# Stroke-Prediction-Analysis
In this notebook we'll deal with analyzing all factors that can lead to stroke. We'll compare what has more impact on stroke and after that we'll build a model to predict whether patient suffers of stroke. This is a classification problem and later we'll se which models we are going to use.
